                                        <div class="pageContent">
                                                <p><b>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. – December 21, 2020</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – </span>FREYR AS and 24M Technologies, Inc. have signed a definitive License and Services Agreement to use 24M’s SemiSolid lithium-ion battery platform technology in FREYR’s planned facilities in Mo i Rana, Norway.</p>
<p>FREYR is targeting the development of over 40 GWh of scalable, modular battery cell production capacity via a phased development approach utilizing deep partnership-based strategies, including in-licensing of next generation technologies. 24M’s SemiSolid platform technology provides unique opportunities for the production of cost-optimized, application-specific designs in both grid and electric mobility markets.</p>
<p>“24M has fundamentally redesigned the traditional LIB cell technology and production platform, delivering higher energy density per battery while enabling substantial reduction in capex, operating costs, CO2 emissions and physical footprint of the manufacturing facility as compared to conventional solutions. By combining the 24M platform with access to clean, low-cost renewable energy and Norway’s highly skilled engineering-based workforce, we will deliver on our goal of delivering safe, high quality batteries with the lowest cost and carbon content. We are now in the process of accelerating and increasing our ambitions to scale up production for all relevant market segments,” said Tom Jensen, the CEO of FREYR.</p>
<p>24M has drastically reduced the number of steps required to manufacture traditional battery cells, while still using conventional lithium-ion raw materials.

<p>The license agreement provides FREYR with rights to unlimited production of battery cells based on 24M’s current and all future technology. This will enable FREYR to benefit from 24M’s ongoing R&amp;D and integrate future versions of the SemiSolid platform into its production and sales of battery cells into all market segments. FREYR will pay both upfront and running fees to 24M.</p>
<p>FREYR is experiencing strong interest for its battery cell production plans based on this technology and the company has recently announced several initial agreements for industrial scale offtake of battery cells in marine and stationary segments and for long-term supply of battery materials and production equipment. FREYR continues to develop partnerships across the value chain, which will be announced as they are formalized.</p>

In addition, Kyocera has extended its commitment to 24M’s unique manufacturing platform with plans to start full-scale mass production in the fall of 2020.</p>
<div class="bw-release-story">
<p>In June 2019, Kyocera began pilot production of 24M’s SemiSolid battery technology to validate its use in residential energy storage systems in the Japanese market. Based on the successful pilot, Kyocera recently rolled out its full Enerezza product line — a 24M-based residential energy storage system available in 5.0 kWh, 10.0 kWh, and 15.0 kWh capacities designed to meet diverse customer needs.</p>
<p>“Kyocera and our customers benefit from long battery life, unparalleled safety, and the low-cost approach enabled by 24M’s unique manufacturing process,” said Toshihide Koyano, Deputy General Manager of Corporate Solar Energy Group at Kyocera. “At Kyocera, we believe that 24M’s SemiSolid technology is the emerging standard for lithium-ion battery manufacturing. We are delighted to be the first company to deliver residential energy storage products using 24M’s novel process.”</p>
<p>24M’s innovative manufacturing process delivers market-leading price-performance. SemiSolid electrodes use no binder, mixing electrolyte with active materials to form a clay-like slurry with unique attributes. As a result, the 24M process eliminates the need for a significant amount of inactive materials and capital-intensive processes like drying and electrolyte filling, thus dramatically reducing manufacturing cost.</p>

The system makes it possible to manufacture cells with compositionally distinct electrolytes — anolytes and catholytes — at scale, enabling next-generation chemistries capable of providing industry-leading energy density (+ 350Wh/kg), while improving cycle life, safety and cost.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 24M SemiSolid electrode platform provides the foundation for its Dual Electrolyte System, dramatically improving overall manufacturing capital efficiency, while allowing distinct approaches to cell design and chemistry. The novel 24M cell architecture uses an ionically conductive, non-permeable separator to isolate the anolyte from the catholyte, while eliminating solid-to-solid interface issues that have plagued full solid-state approaches to date. 24M’s work with numerous world-class materials manufacturers has shown this approach will be both manufacturable and cost-effective. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Using compositionally distinct electrolytes is a game changer for battery manufacturing and we’ve proven the fundamental technology,” said Rick Feldt, President and CEO of 24M. “At the conference, Naoki will discuss how the 24M Dual Electrolyte System expands the universe of potential electrolytes, including water and other materials that to-date have not been compatible with both the anode and cathode simultaneously.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The architecture of the 24M cell and manufacturing process for SemiSolid electrodes have been proven via many tens-of-thousands of cells over the past eight years of development. This work has laid the foundation for the development of the Dual Electrolyte System, the initial testing of which will be discussed at the seminar. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The unique 24M approach to compositionally distinct electrolytes makes it possible for 24M to embark on radical new directions in anode and cathode chemistry,” said Koji Hasegawa, General Manager, Industrial Chemicals Department, Itochu Corporation. “Seldom in lithium-ion battery development has such a possibility been realizable, but the advancement in solid-state ion conductors and 24M’s SemiSolid electrodes opens this possibility.”</span></p>

Using its novel SemiSolid lithium-ion battery design in its pilot facility, 24M achieved energy densities exceeding 250 watt-hours per kilogram (Wh/kg), the current state-of-the-art industry benchmark for EV applications. These deliveries represent a significant milestone in the 24M mission to scale its unique, capital-efficient, low-cost approach to advanced lithium-ion battery manufacturing.</p>
<div class="bw-release-story">
<p>The development of the high energy density nickel manganese cobalt (NMC) cells is part of a $7M three-year contract awarded to 24M in 2016 by the United States Advanced Battery Consortium LLC in cooperation with the <a href="https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.energy.gov%2F&amp;esheet=51945802&amp;newsitemid=20190226005154&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=U.S.+Department+of+Energy&amp;index=2&amp;md5=61311b4d6f1d16a7eddf5c6d9a31c8a5" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">U.S. Department of Energy</a>. The program is chartered with developing electrochemical energy storage technologies that support the commercialization of hybrid, plug-in hybrid, electric and fuel cell vehicles. To achieve the final USABC 2020 density target of 350 Wh/kg by the end of 2019, 24M has developed a multi-faceted, lab-proven approach that includes a novel use of silicon for high energy density anodes.</p>
<p>24M also delivered similar NMC cells with energy densities above 280 Wh/kg to an industrial partner. With these cells, the higher energy densities were achieved by optimizing 24M’s SemiSolid electrode technology, which eliminates the use of a pore-clogging binder, enabling higher active material densities than can be achieved with conventional electrodes. The demonstration of this technology is a major milestone on the 24M roadmap to achieving even higher energy densities (&gt;400 Wh/kg) using its capital-efficient manufacturing process.</p>
<p>“It’s very gratifying to see science translated from the lab into innovative new products as 24M has done by developing and delivering these high energy density cells,” said Naoki Ota, CTO of 24M. “Moreover, we were able to leverage our novel electrode, cell and manufacturing approach to exceed 280 Wh/kg, a significant step towards delivering low-cost lithium-ion cells with industry-leading performance to the EV market.”</p>

<p>The financing was led by advanced ceramics manufacturer Kyocera Group and leading global trading company, ITOCHU Corporation. Also participating in the round were previous investors, including North Bridge Venture Partners.</p>
<p>24M introduced its novel SemiSolid lithium-ion battery design in 2015, and has since leveraged its own semi-automated pilot facility to substantially advance both cell design and production readiness. 24M is now ready to globally scale its unique, capital-efficient, low-cost approach to advanced lithium-ion battery manufacturing.</p>
<p>The SemiSolid process, which uses electrolyte as the processing solvent, eliminates capital and energy intensive steps like drying, solvent recovery, calendaring and electrolyte filling. 24M leverages the process via differentiated cell designs, eliminating the need for significant inactive material (copper, aluminum and separator), resulting in both a structural bill of materials advantage and a lower cost to manufacture. Further, the incorporation of electrolyte during the binderless slurry mixing process presents unique approaches to high energy density cell designs that have heretofore been impossible to explore.</p>
<p>“We’ve been working diligently to advance our innovative technology and manufacturing process to address both the low-cost grid market, and, more recently, the high energy density requirements of the EV market,” said Rick Feldt, President and CEO of 24M. “We recognize the importance of a high-performance, low-cost solution to a market moving towards regional production, and are ready to scale our cells and manufacturing process.”</p>
<p>“Demand for lithium-ion batteries is escalating rapidly due to increasing interest in electric vehicles and renewable energy, and the differentiated 24M manufacturing process and radical approach to cell design offers a powerful solution to cost-effectively respond to this need with a superior product,” said Koji Hasegawa, General Manager, Industrial Chemicals Department of ITOCHU Corporation. “Through this investment, ITOCHU is excited to be working closely with 24M to promote the global production of next-generation SemiSolid lithium-ion batteries.”</p>

The funds will be used to develop novel membranes and lithium-metal anodes for the next generation of high-energy-density, low-cost batteries.</p>
<p>24M’s core technology is semisolid lithium-ion, a new class of lithium-ion batteries that will be initially deployed in stationary storage. With this ARPA-E program, 24M and its partners will extend the capabilities of semisolid electrodes to ultra-high-energy density cells that use lithium-metal anodes. Lithium metal is recognized as an enabler of high-energy density in rechargeable batteries, but has heretofore not been sufficiently stable for aggressive long-life applications. 24M and its partners have identified a new approach to stabilizing the lithium-metal anode, which, when combined with the inherent cost advantages of semisolid lithium-ion technology, can realize the energy-density promise of lithium metal, safely and at low cost.</p>
<p>“As 24M nears commercial shipment of its first generation of energy storage products based on semisolid lithium-ion technology originally developed under ARPA-E support, we are excited to tackle a new grand challenge with partners Sepion Technologies, Berkeley Lab, and Carnegie Mellon University,” said Throop Wilder, CEO and Co-founder of 24M. “We look forward to bringing our team’s innovations to market in a new class of safe, ultra-high-energy density, ultra-low-cost batteries that will propel the energy revolution and enable the holy grail of EV ‘range euphoria.’”</p>
<p>24M received its competitive award from ARPA-E’s Integration and Optimization of Novel Ion Conducting Solids (IONICS) program. The program seeks to advance storage technologies by focusing on the parts of the electrochemical cell that conduct ions and concentrates on solid materials because of the potential for greatly enhanced performance and stability. Further details on the IONICS program can be found HERE.</p>

                        <h1>24M Introduces the Semisolid Lithium-Ion Battery</h1>                        <h3>Company Emerges from Stealth with $50M in Private Capital and a Revolutionary Ne</h3>                    </header>
                                        <div class="pageContent">
                                                <p>Cambridge, MA – June 22, 2015 – Today, 24M emerged from stealth mode to introduce the semisolid lithium-ion cell, a revolutionary technology that solves the grand challenge of energy storage by enabling a new, cost-effective class of the lithium-ion battery. 24M’s semisolid lithium-ion is the most significant advancement in lithium-ion technology in more than two decades and combines an overhaul in battery cell design with a series of manufacturing innovations that, when fully implemented, will slash today’s lithium-ion costs by 50% and improve the performance of lithium-ion batteries. The technology will accelerate the global adoption of affordable energy storage.</p>
<p>Until now, the energy storage field has had two options to try to drive down costs – build massive and complex factories to produce lithium-ion batteries in high volumes or pursue entirely new chemistries that may never move from the lab to the commercial floor. With the invention of the semisolid lithium-ion battery, 24M presents a third option – work with the world’s preferred energy storage chemistry and unlock new opportunities for cost reductions through new cell design and manufacturing innovations. 24M’s platform is the most significant advancement in lithium-ion technology since its debut more than 20 years ago.</p>
<p>“The lithium-ion battery is a brilliant, enabling technology, but its economics are flawed. It’s prohibitively expensive; it’s cumbersome and inefficient to make; and today’s version is approaching the limits of its cost reductions,” said Dr. Yet-Ming Chiang, 24M’s Chief Scientist. “24M has fixed the flaws. We’ve made the world’s favorite battery better, fundamentally changing its cost curve by designing a more elegant and simpler cell and then making the batteries the right way – the way they should have been made from day one.”</p>
<p><strong>Reinvented Cell Design: Enabled by the Semisolid Thick Electrode<br />
</strong>24M’s simple but breakthrough cell design is made possible by the semisolid thick electrode – a material science innovation originating in Dr. Chiang’s lab at MIT. Conventional lithium-ion battery cells have a large fraction of inactive, non-charge carrying materials – supporting metals and plastics – that are layered, one-on-top of the other, within a cell’s casing. Those inactive materials are expensive and wasteful. With the invention of the semisolid thick electrode, 24M eliminates more than 80% of these inactive materials and increases the active layer thickness over traditional Li-ion by up to 5x. Using thick electrodes, the cell also stores more energy, bettering the performance of the battery as well as its cost.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced Manufacturing Platform<br />
</strong>The simplicity of 24M’s new cell design likewise begets a radically simplified advanced manufacturing process. The traditional method for making lithium-ion batteries takes days, is extremely capital intensive and must run at high-volume to achieve economies of scale. 24M’s novel approach to manufacturing yields dramatic improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>From Days to Hours: Start to finish, 24M’s cell creation takes one-fifth of the time of a conventional battery. Because semisolid lithium-ion doesn’t require binding, drying, solvent recovery or calendaring, it removes entire steps in the manufacturing process.</li>
<li>Ultra-low Cost: While the removal of manufacturing steps certainly contributes to lower capex, eliminating the need for entire plants makes semisolid lithium-ion ultra-low cost. A 24M factory requires about one-tenth the investment of a conventional plant.</li>
<li>Flexible and Modular: Manufacturers can scale in small steps to match supply to demand, making lithium-ion cost effective even at low-volume production.</li>
<li>Environmentally Friendly: 24M’s solvent-free manufacturing platform creates the most easily recycled lithium-ion cell ever made.</li>
</ul>
<p>“We give the architects of our energy future everything they love about lithium-ion at a cost they love too,” said Throop Wilder, 24M’s CEO. “Together, our inventions achieve what lithium-ion has yet to do – meet the ultra-low cost targets of the grid and transportation industries.
